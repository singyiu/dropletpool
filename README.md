# DropletPool

## Lossless membership dApp

Users stake a certain amount of coins to join a membership offered by a service provider.
DropletPool would deposit the stake into AAVE, and delivery the yield to the service providers periodically.
When the user no longer need the membership, he or she can simply withdraw 100% of the stake,
And virtually enjoy the membership for free.
It is a new form of lossless and decentralized membership model unlock by the powerful DeFi.
